    "\n",
    "**1. New vehicles:**\n",
    "- The distribution of new vehicles is heavily skewed towards more recent years, with a concentration in the years 2023, 2022.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This skewness suggests that consumers are predominantly purchasing newer models, potentially driven by factors such as advanced features, improved technology, or warranty coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Used vehicles:**\n",
    "- The distribution of used vehicles is more evenly spread across a wider range of manufacturing years, including both recent and older models. Accordingly, it focused on the old vehicles which are around 5, 6, 7 year old.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This broader distribution indicates a diverse selection of used vehicles in the market, providing consumers with options across various age groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Market Dynamics:**\n",
    "- The analysis highlights a clear distinction in the market dynamics between new and used vehicles. New vehicles showcase a trend of rapid turnover, while used vehicles offer a more diverse range of options, accommodating a broader budget spectrum and catering to individuals seeking different model years.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Consumer Preferences:**\n",
    "- Consumer preferences for new vehicles appear to align with the desire for the latest technologies and designs, as evidenced by the concentration in recent manufacturing years.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In contrast, the used vehicle market caters to consumers with varied preferences, including those looking for cost-effective options, classic models, or specific features that may not be present in the newest releases\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Market Opportunities:**\n",
    "- Businesses in the automotive industry can capitalize on the observed trends. Dealerships may focus marketing efforts on promoting the latest models to appeal to consumers interested in new vehicles. Simultaneously, there is an opportunity to emphasize the diverse selection of used vehicles, targeting a broader audience."

    "#### **Analyze the result:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some of the Market Dynamics and Opportunities:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Identifying High-Value Markets**:\n",
    "- \"Unknown\" locations have the highest average car prices, significantly surpassing prices in recognized states and territories.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Businesses can explore and understand the factors contributing to high prices in these unknown locations, potentially uncovering lucrative, niche markets with higher consumer purchasing power.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Targeting Affluent Regions**:\n",
    "- States like New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria (VIC) have relatively high average car prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "- There is an opportunity for dealerships and manufacturers to target these affluent regions with premium or luxury vehicle offerings, as consumers in these \n",
    "areas may be willing to spend more on high-end models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Capitalizing on Demand in ACT**:\n",
    "- The Australian Capital Territory (ACT) has a notable average car price, indicating a potentially affluent market.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Businesses can tailor marketing strategies to emphasize premium features, advanced technologies, or exclusive models to appeal to consumers in the ACT.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Understanding Regional Preferences**:\n",
    "- Tasmania (TAS) and Northern Territory (NT) exhibit higher average prices compared to other states.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Analyzing local preferences, such as a preference for specific vehicle types or features, can help businesses tailor their inventory to meet the demands of these regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Exploring Growth in Western Australia (WA)**:\n",
    "- Western Australia (WA) has a competitive average car price.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Businesses might explore opportunities to further tap into this market by understanding local preferences and potentially introducing models that align with the lifestyle and preferences of consumers in WA.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Offering Value in Queensland (QLD) and South Australia (SA)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Queensland (QLD) and South Australia (SA) have relatively lower average car prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Opportunities lie in offering value-oriented vehicles, promotions, or financing options to appeal to a broader consumer base in these regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. Adapting Strategies for Unknown Locations**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Further investigation is needed for the \"Unknown\" category with the highest average car prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Businesses may want to uncover and target specific cities or regions within this category, adapting their strategies to capitalize on the high-price market potential.\n"

    "**1. Analyze**:\n",
    "\n",
    "*1.1. Year and VehicleAge*\n",
    "\n",
    "- There is a perfect negative correlation of -1.000 between \"Year\" and \"VehicleAge,\" which is expected. As the manufacturing year decreases, the age of the vehicle increases.\n",

    "*1.2. Engine and CylindersinEngine:*\n",
    "\n",
    "- There is a positive correlation of 1.000 between \"Engine\" and \"CylindersinEngine,\" indicating a strong linear relationship. This is expected, as the number of cylinders in the engine is directly related to its size (displacement).\n",
    "\n",
    "*1.3. Kilometres and VehicleAge:*\n",
    "\n",
    "- There is a strong positive correlation of 0.728 between \"Kilometres\" and \"VehicleAge.\" This suggests that older vehicles tend to have higher mileage, which is a logical relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "*1.4. Doors and Seats:*\n",
    "\n",
    "- There is a moderate positive correlation of 0.357 between \"Doors\" and \"Seats.\" This indicates that vehicles with more doors tend to have more seats, which aligns with typical car configurations.\n",

    "*1.5. Price and Year, Engine, Kilometres, CylindersinEngine:*\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"Price\" shows positive correlations with \"Year\" (0.361), \"Engine\" (0.326), and \"CylindersinEngine\" (0.326). This suggests that newer vehicles, larger engine sizes, and more cylinders are associated with higher prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "- There is a negative correlation of -0.398 between \"Price\" and \"Kilometres,\" indicating that as the mileage increases, the price tends to decrease.\n",
    "\n",
    "*1.6. FuelConsumption and other Variables:*\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"FuelConsumption\" shows weak correlations with other variables, indicating that fuel consumption is not strongly linked to variables such as year, engine size, or kilometers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Observation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Newer vehicles tend to be more expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Engine size and the number of cylinders are positively correlated.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Older vehicles have higher mileage.\n",
    "\n",
    "- More doors are associated with more seats.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Price is influenced by factors like newer manufacturing year, larger engine size, and fewer kilometers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.Market Opportunities:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dealerships can emphasize the value of newer models, larger engines, and lower mileage in marketing campaigns to potentially justify higher prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Manufacturers could explore producing vehicles with larger engines, aligning with consumer preferences that contribute to higher prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "- There may be opportunities to market older vehicles with higher mileage as budget-friendly options.\n"
